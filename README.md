Pokemon Game project from Grade 9

Some of the the things implemented:
- Implemented lots of variety with moves - type, flinch, burn, poisoned, paralyzed, priority, crit ratio, recoil, stat altering
- Implemented level up system, with each pokemon learning different moves at different levels
- Implemented evolutions

As a note:
- Was my first time using Classes so there are some OOP conceptual errors
- I unfortunately made it so you have to refer to the pokemon by their full name followed by a number so I reccomend using 3 in the start to check the name of your pokemon
